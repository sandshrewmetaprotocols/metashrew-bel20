# metashrew-ord

Implementation of [https://github.com/ordinals/ord](https://github.com/ordinals/ord) using BST structures for sat ranges.

No use of hardcoded block subsidies, so this implementation is compatible with Dogecoin, in addition to Bitcoin.

Fork this repository to implement arbitrary metaprotocols that are built on inscriptions.
